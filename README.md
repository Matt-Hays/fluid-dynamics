# Industrial Pump Parameter Calculator

Welcome to the **Industrial Pump Parameter Calculator**, a web-based tool designed to aid in the selection and design of
industrial pumps. This application calculates various parameters such as **Total Dynamic Head (TDH)**, **Net Positive
Suction Head Available (NPSHa)**, **minimum submergence requirements**, and more. By entering your pipeline and pump
system data, you can quickly visualize and gauge the expected system performance for different flow rates.

## Overview

**Deployed Application:** [matt-hays.github.io/fluid-dynamics](https://matt-hays.github.io/fluid-dynamics)  
**Technology Stack:** Vue 3, TypeScript, Chart.js

This tool is particularly useful for **engineers and pump specialists** seeking a quick way to approximate or visualize
the performance requirements of their pumping systems. By inputting your system parameters (**pressures, elevations,
flow rates, pipeline roughness, etc.**), the application calculates an expected total head curve.

---

## Features

- **Real-time Chart Rendering** – View the **TDH vs. flow rate** in real-time using Chart.js.
- **Multiple Pipeline Sections** – Define as many pipeline sections as needed, each with its own **roughness, diameter,
  and minor loss factors (k-values)**.
- **Metric or Imperial Units** – Choose between **metric** and **imperial** units for flow rate, elevations, and
  pressures.
- **Daylighted End** – Account for **velocity head at the pipeline discharge** (open to atmosphere) if your system end
  is daylighted.
- **Data Validation** – Basic validations ensure your input values are **sensible** before generating the curves.

---

## How to Use

### 1. Open the Application

Navigate to [matt-hays.github.io/fluid-dynamics](https://matt-hays.github.io/fluid-dynamics). You will see a header link
labeled **“System Curves.”**

### 2. Fill Out Pipeline Information

- **Inlet/Discharge Flow Rate** – Enter flow rates for your system’s inlet and outlet.
- **Inlet/Discharge Pressure** – If you have measured or specified pressures at the system boundaries, enter them here.
- **Elevations** – Specify minimum/maximum elevations at the start and end.
- **Kinematic Viscosity** – Provide a representative value for your fluid.
- **End Daylighted** – Check this box if your pipeline outlet is open to atmosphere (i.e., draining freely).
- **Metric Units** – Check this box if your values are in metric (m, kPa, etc.).

### 3. Add Pipeline Sections

Each section can have unique properties:

- **Absolute Roughness** (pipe material surface roughness)
- **Section Length**
- **Diameter**
- **Material**
- **k-Values** (minor loss coefficients for fittings, bends, valves, etc.)

Click **“Add Section”** if your pipeline has multiple segments. You can also remove a section if it is not needed.

### 4. Submit Pipeline Data

After entering all the details, click **“Submit Pipeline Data.”**  
The chart on top will update to show:

- **TDH Max** – The total dynamic head considering the **highest possible static head**.
- **TDH Min** – The total dynamic head considering the **lowest possible static head**.

That’s it! You can now observe how your pipeline’s **TDH changes with flow rate**, which helps in **pump selection and
system design**.

## Creating an Issue

If you have a **feature request**, a **question**, or have encountered a **bug**, you can let the development team know
by creating a **GitHub issue**.

> **Note:** If you are new to GitHub, think of an **“issue”** as a way to ask a question or request something. You do
> not need to understand code to create an issue.

### Steps:

1. **Go to the Repository on GitHub**  
   Navigate to the repository:  
   👉 [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/matt-hays/fluid-dynamics)   
2. **Click on the “Issues” Tab**  
   At the top of the repository page, click **“Issues.”**
3. **Press the “New Issue” Button**  
   On the Issues page, find and click the green **“New Issue”** button.
4. **Add a Title and Description**
    - **Title:** Briefly summarize your request or problem (e.g., _"Add NPSHa Calculation"_ or _"Bug: Pressure Units Not
      Converting Correctly"_).
    - **Description:** Provide more details. If it is a feature request, explain what you’d like to see. If it’s a bug,
      describe what happened (e.g., _"I entered a negative flow rate and it crashed."_).
5. **Add a Label**  
   Select the appropriate label for your request (e.g., _"Enhancement"_, _"Bug"_, etc.).
6. **Submit Your Issue**  
   Click **“Submit new issue.”**

## What Happens After You Create an Issue

The **development team** will review your issue and decide on the next steps:

- ✅ **Accept** – They might plan to work on it immediately or add it to a future milestone.
- ❓ **Request More Information** – They may ask for additional details.
- ❌ **Close** – They may close the issue if it’s a duplicate, not feasible, or out of scope.

> **Note:** Creating an issue does **not guarantee** implementation. The project owner will decide based on **project
goals and priorities**.
